# Having issues with the modpack?
If you experience any crashes or such you can open an issue here and I'll try my best to fix whatever is causing the crash.
If the issue is out of my hands (such as being caused by a mod directly rather than a conflict) I'll report it to the mod author and if it gets fixed I'll update the modpack to resolve the issue as well.
